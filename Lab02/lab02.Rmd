# Introduction

The material is based on [Ognyanova, K. (2021) Network visualization with R](https://kateto.net/network-visualization). Special thanks also to Emanuele Aliverti for sharing part of this material. 

In network maps several key elements are used to control the outcome. The major ones are *color*, *size*, *shape*, and *position*.

# An example of network: 3 million Russian troll tweets

In this tutorial, we will analyze data used in the *FiveThirtyEight* story [Why Weâ€™re Sharing 3 Million Russian TrollTweets](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-were-sharing-3-million-russian-troll-tweets/). The original data set is composed by $3$ million of tweets from suspected twitter account. The data are prepossessed, if you want to see the original data set, please see this [link](https://www.kaggle.com/fivethirtyeight/russian-troll-tweets).

We want to analyze the interaction structure between these twitter profiles, excluding (in this case) the interaction (comment/re tweet), the direction, and the number of time this interaction appear (size of the edge). You can find the data set in the `Datasets` folder. It is composed by two matrices, `Y` describes the edges (two-column matrix, where each row defines one edge), while `X` report some information about the nodes (i.e., twitter profiles, $1245$ in total):

- `accountcategory`: main category for type of account, e.g., Commercial, NewsFeed, etc (macro category);

- `accounttype`: type of account (thinner account category than `accountcategory`);

- `activity`: number of activities;

- `maxfollowers`: maximum number of followers profiles;

- `maxfollowing`: maximum number of following profiles;

- `maxpostdate`: last registered post;

- `minfollowers`: minimum number of followers profiles;

- `minfollowing`: minimum number of following profiles;

- `minpostdate`: first registered post;

- `vertex.names`: name of the twitter account (i.e., the name of the node of the graph).

# Edge, vertex and attributes

First of all, we must load the dataset and the `igraph` package. You can find the dataset `russian_trolls` in `Lab02/Datasets`. 

```{r}
load("Datasets/russian_trolls.RData")
library(igraph)
```

So, let's transform our data set as an `igraph` class object:

:::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto auto; grid-column-gap: 5px; place-items: start;"}
::: {}
__R commands__ 

```{r}
net = graph_from_edgelist(Y,directed = F) 

for(j in 1:ncol(X)){ 
  net = net %>% 
    set_vertex_attr(name = colnames(X)[j],
                    value = X[,j]) 
}

V(net)$name = V(net)$vertex.names 
```
:::
::: {}
__Comments__ 

* `graph_from_edgelist(x)` -- creates a graph from a two column matrix `x`.
* `set_vertex_attr(name = x, value = y)` -- set vertex attributes, where `x` is the name of the attribute, and `y` is the value of the attribute.
* In the last line we name the nodes using the variable `vertex.names`, we can access to the vertex-level name of the graph `x` attribute by `V(x)$name`.
:::
::::

> `r emo::ji("boom")` **_Please note_** _you can create the `igraph` class object also if you have a data.frame thanks to the `graph_from_data_frame` function (or you can transform the edgelist as data.frame or reverse). There is also the function `graph_from_adjacency_matrix` to create an `igraph` graph object from adjacency matrices._

Let's take a look of our new graph:

```{r}
summary(net)
```

The `igraph` objects is described by four letters:

1. *D* or *U* for directed or undirected graph;
2. *N* for named graph (where nodes have a name attribute);
3. *W* for a weighted graph (where edges have a weight attribute);
4. *B* for a bipartite graph (in short: two disjoint sets of nodes where each node of a set is connected with another node in the other set).

So, there are two numbers ($1245$ and $2857$) which refer to the number of nodes and edges in the graph.

Then, we have the list of node and edge attributes. For example (v/c) is vertex-level character attribute.

Before we saw how see the vertex-level attribute `name`. You can access to nodes, edges and their attributes by:


:::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto auto; grid-column-gap: 5px; place-items: start;"}
::: {}
__R commands__ 

```{r}
E(net) 
V(net)
list.vertex.attributes(net)
```
:::
::: {}
__Comments__ 

* `E(x)`: call the edge sequence of graph `x`;
* `V(x)`: call the vertex sequence of graph `x`;
* `list.vertex.attributes(x)`: return the list names of vertex attributes of graph `x `.

# Degree, geodesic distance, closeness, and betweenness

First of all, we will eliminate the nodes without connections, i.e., degree equals $0$.

> `r emo::ji("star")` **Remember**: The degree indicates the number of adjacent
nodes, that is the number of nodes to which the node is connected. It measures how connected a node is, so it is a local measure.

:::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto auto; grid-column-gap: 5px; place-items: start;"}
::: {}
__R commands__ 

```{r}
net = delete_vertices(net, which(igraph::degree(net) < 1))
```
:::
::: {}
__Comments__ 

* `delete_vertices(x, y)`: Delete vertices `y` from a graph `x`;
* `degree(x)`: compute the degree for each node of graph `x`;
* `which(igraph::degree(x) < 1)`: return the index where the nodes of the graph `x` has degree less than $1$. 
:::
::::

Then, also we can see which are the nodes with high degree:

```{r}
D_net = igraph::degree(net)
sort(D_net,decreasing = T)[1:5]
```

and we can represent the nodes in a histogram:

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(D_net,nclass = 100, main = "Degree distribution", xlab = "Degree")
hist(igraph::degree(net,normalized = T),nclass=100, main = "Degree distribution (normalized)", xlab = "Normalized degree")
```

The normalized degrees are simply the degrees divided by $(V-1)$ where $V$ is the number of nodes. So, we have a measure with range $[0,1]$.

We can compute also the **graph density**, which is the ratio of the number of edges and the number of possible edges (i.e., it is a global measure):

```{r}
edge_density(graph = net)
```


The network follows a `` power-law`` structure, where the distribution of the nodes has an exponential decay as the degree increases: many nodes have a small number of connections ($1$ or $2$), while a small number of nodes have many. Clearly the shape of the distribution does not change when considering the normalized or absolute quantity. The distribution of normalized degrees, however, allows us to observe that even the most connected nodes present a small number of connections, compared to the size of the network. This result is not surprising, if we consider that the density of the network is about $0.004$. That is, of all the possible connections, we observe approximately $4$ out of $1000$.

A fundamental concept is the **geodesic distance**. The `igraph` library computes this quantities efficiently. For example, to calculate the path connecting two nodes:

```{r}
shortest_paths(graph = net,from = "aiden7757",to = "_nickluna_")$vpath
```

So, the shortest path includes $5$ vertices names `aiden7757`, ` andyhashtagger`, `bgarner2107`, `politweecs` and `_nickluna_`.

> `r emo::ji("star")` **Remember**: The geodesic distance is the length of the shortest path connecting two nodes.

We are now interested to compute the **mean distance between nodes**, i.e., the mean length of the paths:

```{r}
average.path.length(graph = net)
```

> `r emo::ji("star")` **Remember**: Average path length is a concept in network topology that is defined as the average number of steps along the shortest paths for all possible pairs of network nodes.

So the average path length equals $5.15$. Also, we can compute the matrix $S$ of total distances between all possible couples of nodes:

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(1,1))
S = distances(graph = net)
image(S,col = gray.colors(n = diameter(net))) 
#The diameter of a graph is the length of the longest geodesic.
```

> `r emo::ji("star")` **Remember**: In addition to the *degree*, there are other local measures to assess the importance of a node within the network. The most important are 

- *closeness*: how many steps is required to access every other vertex from a given vertex, i.e., how easily a node can reach other nodes:

$$
\dfrac{V-1}{\sum_{i \ne v} d_{vi}}
$$

- *betweenness*: analyze the number of geodesics (shortest paths) going through a vertex or an edge, i.e., how relevant is a node in terms of connecting other nodes in a graph:

$$
\dfrac{2\dfrac{\sum_{i \ne j}g_{ivj}}{g_{ij}}}{(V-1)(V-2)}
$$

where $g_{ivj}$ is the total number of shortest paths between vertices $i$ and $j$ while $g_{ivj}$ is the number of those shortest paths which pass though vertex $v$. Normalized by the number of ordered or unordered vertex pairs.

```{r}
C_net = igraph::closeness(graph = net, normalized = TRUE)
B_net = igraph::betweenness(graph = net,normalized = TRUE) 
```

So, let's see now the distribution of the closeness and betweeness measure:

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(C_net, breaks = 50)
hist(B_net, breaks = 50)
```

```{r}
names(which.max(C_net))
names(which.min(C_net))
```

So, the account `ann_hanah` is the node closest to the other, while `jeromyjerom` is the less one.

```{r}
names(which.max(B_net))
names(which.min(B_net))
```
So, the account `matevidence` is the most relevant node in our graph in terms of connecting nodes, while `_anna_sanna_` the less one (gatekeepers of information).

It is possible that we have group of nodes disconnected, in order to see how our network is composed we can use the `components()` function:

```{r}
subg = components(graph = net)
subg$csize
```

The network we are analysing has one very extensive component, consisting of $1149$ nodes, and several components consisting of very few nodes ($2$ or $4$). There is also a component formed by $35$ nodes, which forms an isolated group and which may be interesting to analyse at a later date. For the moment, we focus only on the largest component, excluding the other nodes from the analysis. We recalculate the statistics mentioned above and evaluate which nodes are associated with higher values.

```{r}
net = igraph::delete.vertices(net, which(subg$membership != 1))
C_net = igraph::closeness(graph = net,normalized = T)
B_net = igraph::betweenness(graph = net,normalized = T)
D_net = igraph::degree(net,normalized = T)
```

```{r}
sort(C_net,decreasing = T)[1:5]
sort(D_net,decreasing = T)[1:5]
sort(B_net,decreasing = T)[1:5]
```
> What happened?

So, let's see now the distribution of the closeness and betweeness measure:

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(C_net, breaks = 50)
hist(B_net, breaks = 50)
```

Closeness presents a bimodal distribution, with one around $0.16$ and another on higher values. Betweenness, on the other hand, presents a strongly asymmetrical distribution.

For example,

```{r}
sum(B_net > .1)
```

We observe that only 6 nodes have a betweennes greater than $0.1$. We might also ask if and how these statistics are related. 


> **_Question:_** _As as the degree increases, so do betwennes and closeness?_

Let's compute the correlation between these measures:

```{r}
cor(cbind(B_net,D_net,C_net))
```

and corresponding pair plots:

```{r}
library(GGally)
ggpairs((data.frame(B_net,D_net,C_net))) + theme_bw()
```

The data suggest that there is some association between **degree** and **betweennes**: nodes with a higher number of connections (degree) are more likely to lie on the shortest paths between other pairs of nodes (betweeness).

If there is a strong positive correlation between **degree** and **closeness**: Nodes that have many direct connections to other nodes in the graph (high degree) are also more centrally located in terms of their overall proximity to other nodes (high closeness centrality).

If there is a strong positive correlation between **betweennes** and **closeness**: Nodes that are well positioned to carry out a rapid transfer of information within the graph (high closeness centrality) are also those that play a crucial role in controlling communications between different nodes (high betweenness centrality).

# Network and group

The Russian troll network is clearly characterized by different groups. Of particular interest is, for instance, the type of account (i.e., `accounttype` variable), which is divided into several macro-categories. There is also a less fine division, i.e., the `accountcategory` variable.

```{r}
aType = vertex_attr(graph = net,name="accounttype")
```

```{r}
table(aType)
```


We clean up the various strings with the use of some regular expressions. Note that `$ ` makes a match for an empty string (`^` represents the beginning of a line,`$` the end), and that the $?$ must be preceded by the escape characters `\`.

```{r}
require(stringr)
aType = str_to_title(aType)
aType = str_replace(aType,"Ukranian","Russian")
aType = str_replace(aType,"Commercial|Local","News")
aType = str_replace(aType,"Koch","Fear")
aType = str_replace(aType,"^$|Arabic|\\?", "Other")
table(aType)
```

At this point, we may be interested in some characteristics of our groups. 

> **_Question:_** _How does the distribution of degree, betweeness and  closeness centrality vary between the three largest groups?_

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
df_pl = data.frame(den=D_net, clos = C_net, bet = B_net, x=aType)
#gather(df_pl,"den","clos","bet")
df_pl %>% dplyr::filter(x %in% c("Right","Left","Russian")) %>%
gather(.,"den","clos","bet",key="stat",value = "value") %>%
ggplot(aes(value,after_stat(density),color=x)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(lwd=1)+ 
  facet_wrap(~stat,scales="free")+ 
  theme_bw()
```

In general we do not expect there to be much difference from these statistics if the communities represent reasonable social groups. The three groups are homogeneous with respect to degree and betweenness, while they differ somewhat in with respect to closeness. Thus, we can conclude that the group of trolls categorized as Left are less close to each other than the others. This characteristic is in itself interesting, and suggests that this group is less compact and therefore also more open to connections with the outside world. To explore these considerations further, we could evaluate for instance, how the geodesic distance varies between the two groups, and whether these differences are due only to a few nodes.

A natural question at this point is whether the division into groups is "good" in terms of cohesion.

```{r}
modularity(net,factor(aType))
assortativity(net,factor(aType))
```

> `r emo::ji("star")` **Remember**:
- *modularity*: Fraction of edges connecting nodes in the same group minus the expected value of the same quantity in a network with random connections: high modularity $\rightarrow$ strong distinct defined communities.
- *assortativity*: measures the level of homophyly of the graph, based on some vertex labeling or values assigned to vertices. If the coefficient is high, that means that connected vertices tend to have the same labels or similar assigned values.

The division actually leads to very high values of *assortativity*, confirming a strong homophily with respect to the group. 

This result confirms that trolls tend to interact more with others belonging to the same political sphere or sphere of interest, creating many connections between profiles that are similar to them and few with those that are different.

# Subgroups and communities

**Can we do better?** 

We try to obtain a more interesting partition by estimating the groups on the basis of connections (the groups from before do not use this information!).

**Objective**: To divide the network into communities of nodes, so that nodes within each community have many connections between them, while nodes in different communities have few connections. There are a lot of approaches:

- *Louvain method*

- *Stochastic block models*

- *Spectral methods*

- etc

Here, we will apply the first one, the Louvain method, we will not go into details, but it find community (subgraphs) optimazing the modularity measure.


```{r}
gr = cluster_louvain(graph = net)
#gr2 = cluster_fast_greedy(graph = net)
```

Note that the `cluster_louvain(x)` function as other `cluster_` function of the package `igraph` returns and object of class `communities`:

```{r}
class(gr)
```

This is useful since if we have a `communities` class object, we can call other operations related to this class like:

- `membership(x)`: gives the division of the vertices, into communities. It returns a numeric vector, one value for each vertex, the id of its community. Community ids start from one;

- `modularity(x)`: gives the modularity score of the partitioning.

```{r}
table(membership(gr))
assortativity(net,membership(gr))
```

The method identifies $K=11$ communities (too many?), and produces a partition with very high *modularity*:

```{r}
modularity(gr)
```

So, summing up  `modularity(x)` can take as input the graph with the membership vector of the community structure or directly the `community` objects.

> **_Question:_** _What is the relationship between the groups identified by the *Louvain* method and those referred to the sphere of influence, i.e., the `aType` variable?_ 


```{r}
table(membership(gr), aType)
```

> `r emo::ji("boom")` **Please note**! _If you do not have a large graph (i.e., graphs with up to fifty vertices), you can use the `cluster_optimal` function which calculates the optimal community structure of a graph, by maximizing the *modularity* measure over all possible partitions._

# Concluding

> `r emo::ji("boom")` **_Please note_** _save your workspace! We will use the objects created now in the next tutorial._

```{r}
save(list = ls(), file = "lab02.RData")
```
