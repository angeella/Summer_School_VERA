### What is reproducibility?

*<p style="text-align: center;">"Reproducibility refers to the ability of a researcher to duplicate the results of a prior study using the same materials as were used by the original investigator. That is, a second researcher might use the same raw data to build the same analysis files and implement the same statistical analysis in an attempt to yield the same results. Reproducibility is a minimum necessary condition for a finding to be believable and informative."</p>*

[Report of the Subcommittee on Replicability in Science Advisory Committee to the National Science Foundation Directorate for Social, Behavioral, and Economic Sciences](https://www.nsf.gov/sbe/AC_Materials/SBE_Robust_and_Reliable_Research_Report.pdf)

The results obtained from an experiment, observational study or statistical analysis of a dataset should be repeated with a **high degree of confidence** when the study is replicated.

class: highlight-last-item

### What is reproducibility?

So:

> All **results** should be documented, making all **data** and **code** available so that calculations can be run again with identical results.

<br><br>

In recent decades, there has been a growing concern that many published scientific results fail reproducibility tests, giving rise to a **REPRODUCIBILITY CRISIS**.

--



---
class: highlight-last-item

### When did the reproducibility crisis begin?

A 2016 [survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) in Nature revealed that irreproducible experiments are a problem across all domains of science:

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width=700}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/reproducibility_nature.jpg")
```

---
class: highlight-last-item

### When we fall into it?

- Not enough **documentation** on how experiment is conducted and data is generated

--

- **Data** used to generate original results unavailable

--

- **Software** used to generate original results unavailable

--

- Difficult to recreate software environment (libraries, versions) used to generate original results

--

- Difficult to rerun the computational step

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width=600}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/Miracle.jpg")
```



---
class: highlight-last-item

A published article is like the top of a **pyramid**. It rests on multiple levels that each contributes to its **reproducibility**.

<br/><br/>


```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/repro-pyramid.png")
```

---

### Reproducible, replicable, robust, generalisable

While **reproducibility** is the minimum requirement and can be solved with "good enough" computational practices, **replicability/robustness/generalisability** of scientific findings are an even greater concern involving research misconduct, questionable research practices (p-hacking, HARKing, cherry-picking), sloppy methods, and other conscious and unconscious biases.

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center", out.width=500}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/39-reproducible-replicable-robust-generalisable.jpg")
```


---
class: highlight-last-item

## The world is on the move...

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = 500, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
load(file = "data/google.RData")

df <- df %>% 
  dplyr::mutate(years = as.numeric(years)) %>%
  dplyr::filter(years %in% c(1999:2022)) 

ggplot(as.data.frame(table(df$years)), aes(x=Var1, y = Freq)) + geom_bar(stat="identity", fill = "#ac0033") + xlab("Years") + theme_classic() +
  scale_x_discrete(breaks = round(seq(min(df$years), max(df$years), by = 5),1)) + ggtitle("686 papers from Google scholar") + 
     theme(axis.title=element_text(size=15))


```

### How to make a reproducible research


- Share **data** (raw and pre-processed ones): The lack of data sharing is an obstacle to international research (be it academic, governmental, or commercial) for two main reasons:

    - It is generally difficult or impossible to reproduce a study without the original data.
    
--

    - The data cannot be reused or incorporated into new work by other researchers if they cannot obtain access to it.




---
class: highlight-last-item

### How to make a reproducible research


- Share **code** used for the analysis (clearly commented): code sharing enables others to be able to

--

    1. **understand** (to read and analyze) the computational parts of the work done in the article.
    
--

    1. **reproduce** (run) the computational parts of the work done in the article. 
    
--

    1. **build** on code used in the computational parts of the work done in the article, for their own work.
    
--

    1. **add** to the code used in the computational parts of the work done in the article, to improve it.
    
--

    1. **cite** the software and credit its authors when they use it.
    
--

- Write **reproducible scientific paper**



---
class: highlight-last-item

## Ingredients - share data and code

- [Datalad](https://www.datalad.org/): a free and open source distributed **data management system** that keeps track of your data, creates structure, ensures reproducibility, supports collaboration, and integrates with widely used data infrastructure.

--

- [GitHub](https://github.com/): an online software development platform used for storing, tracking, and collaborating on **software projects**. It enables developers to upload their own code files and to collaborate with fellow developers on open-source projects.

--

- [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/): a general-purpose open repository developed under the European OpenAIRE program and operated by CERN. It allows researchers to **deposit research papers, data sets, research software, reports**, and any other research related digital artefacts. For each submission, a persistent digital object identifier (DOI) is minted, which makes the stored items easily citeable.



---
class: highlight-last-item

## Ingredients - write reproducible papers

We will use **`Rmarkdown`** because it is:

  1. **EFFICIENT**:
  
    - write text, cite sources, tidy data, analyse, table, and plot it in one programme/screen
    - re-do one, more, or all of these with ease $\rightarrow$ decrease the possibility of making mistakes in the process
    
--

  1. **FLEXIBLE**: output to various formats (e.g., `HTML`, `LaTeX`, `PDF`, `Word`)

--

  1. **OPEN ACCESS/SOURCE**:
  
    - use for free
    - create documents accessible to anyone with a computer and internet connection
    - benefit from the work of a great community of users/developers

--



---
class: highlight-last-item

## Ingredients - write reproducible papers

**`Rmarkdown`** permits to have **reproducibilty BEFORE publication**:

- Having written a complete draft with data including re-coded variables, tables, figures, and text with references to specific results (e.g., numbers from summary and/or regression statistics)
- If you and/or your co-authors decide to reverse a re-coded variable to its previous/original measure and/or, to exclude a subgroup of observations from analysis
- Draft written as completely reproducible draft which leads to easy revision of the analysis after receving some comments from journal's reviewers.

--

and **reproducibility AFTER publication**:

- After your paper is published, if others, including your future self, would like to test how robust the results are
- to reversing a re-coded variable to its previous/original measure
- and/or, to excluding a subgroup of observations from analysis

# Let's start!!


---
class: highlight-last-item

## First steps

1. Create an **`RStudio` project**

--

1. Link the **`RStudio` project** to a **`GitHub`** repository

--

1. Create an **`Rmarkdown`** (`.rmd`) file.

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://tenor.com/view/kios-angry-computer-stare-gif-16068406.gif")
```



---
### Using `RStudio` projects

**`RStudio` projects** make it straightforward to divide your work into multiple contexts, each with their own working directory, workspace, history, and source documents.

To create a new project in the `RStudio` IDE, use the `New Project` command (available on the `Projects` (top right corner) menu or go to `File > New Project`. You will have the following window:

```{r,echo=FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/projects_new.png")
```


---
class: highlight-last-item

### Using `RStudio` projects

When a new project is created `RStudio`:

- Creates a **project file** (with an `.Rproj` extension) within the project directory. This file contains various project options and can also be used as a shortcut for opening the project directly from the filesystem.

--

- Creates a **hidden directory** (named `.Rproj.user`) where project-specific temporary files (e.g. auto-saved source documents, window-state, etc.) are stored. This directory is also automatically added to `.Rbuildignore`, `.gitignore`, etc. if required.

--

- **Loads the project** into `RStudio` and display its name in the `Projects` toolbar (which is located on the far right side of the main toolbar).



---
class: highlight-last-item

### Using `RStudio` projects

There are several ways to **open a project**:

- Using the `Open Project` command (available from both the `File` menu and the `Projects` toolbar) to browse for and select an existing project file (e.g. `MyProject.Rproj`).

--

- Selecting a project from the list of most recently opened projects (also available from both the `File` menu and the `Projects` toolbar).

--

- Double-clicking on the project file within the system shell (e.g. Windows Explorer, OSX Finder, etc.).



---
class: highlight-last-item

### Using `RStudio` projects

When a project is opened within `RStudio` the following actions are taken:

- A new `R` session (process) is started

--

- The `.Rprofile` file (user-controllable files to set options and environment variables) in the project's main directory (if any) is sourced by `R`

--

- The `.RData` file (where the objects are stored) in the project's main directory is loaded (if project options indicate that it should be loaded).

--

- The `.Rhistory` file (a history of code executed, not written) in the project's main directory is loaded into the `RStudio History` window.

--

- The current working directory is set to the **project directory**.

--

- Previously edited source documents are restored into editor tabs

--

- Other `RStudio` settings (e.g. active tabs, splitter positions, etc.) are restored to where they were the last time the project was closed.


---
### `GitHub`

Open `GitHub Desktop` and go to `Add > Create new repository`
  
```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = 400}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/github_desktop.PNG")
```

---
class: highlight-last-item

### `GitHub`

- **Name**: here you must put the repository name (same name used for the `RStudio` project);

--

- **Description**: here you can put a description of the project;

--

- **Local path**: here you must put the path where the `RStudio` project is. There is also the option `Choose..` for navigating directly into your computer;

--

- **Inizialize the repository with a README**: flag it! Here you must describe what the repository contains.

<br><br>

then click on `Create repository`!



---
### `GitHub`

and `Publish repository`!

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = 1000}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/github_desktop1.PNG")
```

---
### `GitHub`

> **Every time that you make a change on your `RStudio` projects, you can push these changes in the `GitHub` repositories**

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = 1000}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/github_desktop2.PNG")
```

---
class: highlight-last-item

### `GitHub`

- **PUSH**: Changes in the local repository go to the `GitHub` repository

--

- **PULL**: Changes in the `GitHub` repository go to the local repository

Here, I presented the *easiest* way to manage `GitHub` with `RStudio`. However, `RStudio` has the possibility to manage `GitHub` directly using `Git`. For more details:

- [https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r/](https://rfortherestofus.com/2021/02/how-to-use-git-github-with-r/)

- [https://annakrystalli.me/talks/r-in-repro-research.html#27](https://annakrystalli.me/talks/r-in-repro-research.html#27)

<br><br>

So, everything is ready for creating our amazing `Rmarkdown` project!



---

### Before `Rmarkdown`...

Let see how `RStudio` is constructed:

--

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/rstudio.PNG")
```

---

### `Rmarkdown` document

To use R `Markdown`, you have to install `R` and the `R` package `rmarkdown`. I will talk about packages later. Simply write on `RStudio` console (bottom-left window):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```

--

`Rmarkdown` (`.Rmd)` integrates:

- a **documentantion** language (`.md`),

- a **programming** language (`R`),

- functionality to "knit" them together through `r emo::ji("knit")` `knitr`.

--

**Features**:

- provides a framework for writing narratives around code and data,

- code re-run in a clean environment every time the document is "knit" `r emo::ji("knit")`.

---

### `Rmarkdown` document

Clicking on `File > New File > RMarkdown... > Document` you will create the following `RMarkdown` file:

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = 1000}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/rmarkdown.PNG")
```

---

### `Rmarkdown` document

Clicking on `r emo::ji("knit")` `Knit` you will create the following `html` file:

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = 1000}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/rmarkdown1.PNG")
```

---
class: highlight-last-item


### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document

The `Rmarkdown` document has three components:

1. **YAML**: for setting metadata

--

1. **Text**: your text

--

1. **Code chunks**: your `R` script

--

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.width = 1000}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/rmarkdown2.PNG")
```



---
class: highlight-last-item


### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - YAML

- `.Rmd` documents start with YAML which  includes the metadata variables e.g., title, output format. It is written between a pair of three hyphens -

--

- Documents as output formats include HTML, LaTeX, PDF, Word, e.g.,

```{r, eval = FALSE}
title: "Untitled"
author: "Angela Andreella"
date: "2022-10-21"
output: word_document
```

other are: `html_document`, `pdf_document`, `latex_document`, `odt_document`, `github_document`, `md_document`, `rtf_document`, `powerpoint_presentation`, `beamer_presentation`, `iosslides_presentation`, `slidy_presentation`.


---
class: highlight-last-item


### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - YAML

You can also specify:

- `bibliography` as `.bib` file (it must be in the same folder of the `.Rmd` file) or specify the full path where the `.bib` file is.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
title: "Untitled"
author: "Angela Andreella"
date: "2022-10-21"
output: word_document
bibliography: references.bib
```

There are many other options, see [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook)

---
class: highlight-last-item

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Text

- **Multiple spaces** on a given line are reduced to **one**;

--

- Line endings with **fewer than two spaces** are **ignored**;

--

- Two or more spaces at the end of lines introduce **hard breaks**, forcing a new line;

--

- Spaces on lines that start with a vertical line `|` are **kept**;

--

- Lines starting with the greater-than sign `>` introduce **block quotes**;

--

- **One or more blank** lines introduce a **new paragraph**,

--

- Text with the syntax `<!- - comments - - >` is **omitted** from output



---
class: highlight-last-item

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Text

- The sign `#` introduces **headers**; lower levels are created with additional signs - up to total five levels:

  - `# Introduction` becomes 
  # Introduction

  - `## Introduction` becomes 
  ## Introduction

  
  - etc
  
---
class: highlight-last-item

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Text

- `*italics*` becomes *italics*

--

- `*bold*` becomes *bold*

--

- `**_bolditalics_**` becomes **_bolditalics_**

--

- `~~strikethrough~~` becomes ~~strikethrough~~

--

- `[see this website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpCrY7x5nEE)` becomes [see this website](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FpCrY7x5nEE)

--

- `[email me](mailto:angela.andreella@unive.it)` becomes [email me](mailto:angela.andreella@unive.it)



---
class: highlight-last-item

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Text

- Inline equations go between a pair of single dollar signs `$` - with no space between the signs and the equation itself:

    `$E = mc^{2}$` becomes $E = mc^{2}$

- Block equations go in between a pair of double dollar signs - with or without spaces, it works:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
$$E = mc^{2}$$
```

becomes $$E = mc^{2}$$

---
class: highlight-last-item

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Text

Lines starting with asterisk $*$ as well as plus $+$ or minus $-$ signs introduce **lists**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
- books
- articles
- reports
```

- books
- articles
- reports


---

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Text

Lists can be **nested** within each other, with indentation:


```{r, eval = FALSE}
+ books
+ articles
    - published
    - under review
        + revised and resubmitted
    - work in progress
```

+ books
+ articles
    - published
    - under review
        + revised and resubmitted
    - work in progress
    
---

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Text   

List items can be **numbered**:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
1. books
2. articles
    - published
    - under review
        + revised and resubmitted
    - work in progress
```

1. books
2. articles
    - published
    - under review
        + revised and resubmitted
    - work in progress
    
---

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Managing References

**References** are defined in `.bib` files, they follow the `BibTeX` format `r emo::ji("book")`.

You can take the reference in the `BibTeX` format directly from google scholar:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/rmarkdown3.PNG")
```

---

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Managing References

All citations keys take the 'at' sign `@` while square brackets and/or minus signs introduce variation

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/rmarkdown4.PNG")
```

The list of references appears **after the last line of the output document, with no section header**. So that you can choose the header yourself, by ending ``.Rmd` documents with a header of your choice

---
class: highlight-last-item

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Code

Most codes go inside **code chunks**, delimited between a pair of **three backticks** 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/rmarkdown5.PNG")
```

Codes can also go in line with text using 

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Images/rmarkdown6.PNG")
```

On the same line with the first delimiter, and in curly brackets `{`, code chunks take

- a **language** engine, e.g., `R`, `Python`..

--

- a **label** after the comma (recommended but optional), It can be helpful for navigating through error messages). Duplicate labels lead to errors during compilation

--

- one or more options, e.g., `include`, `echo`, `out.width`,..

 


---
class: highlight-last-item

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Code

Some of the most used **options**:

- `include = FALSE`: do not include the output

--

- `echo = FALSE`: do not print the code

--

- `warning = FALSE`: exclude the warning message

--

- `comment = FALSE`: exclude the comments 

--

- `eval = FALSE`: do not run the code

--

- `out.height = 50%`, `out.width = 50%`: define the size of figures as they appear in the output document

--

- `fig.align="center"`: Define the alignment of figures - `left`, `right`, or `center`

--

- `fig.caption="my caption`: Define the caption for figures

The complete list of options is available at [https://yihui.org/knitr/options](https://yihui.org/knitr/options).


---
class: highlight-last-item

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Code

It is recommended to use the **first code chunk** for general setup, where you can:

- define your own **defaults** for chunk options, with `knitr::opts_chunk$set()`

--

- load the necessary **packages**

--

- import **raw data**




---
class: highlight-last-item

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Figure and tables

There are many ways to include a **figure** in a `Rmarkdown` document:

- `![Figure Caption](figure.extension)` in the text.

--

- `knitr::include_graphics("Images/figure.extension")` in a code chuck.

--

- directly using `R` functions in a code chuck.

as well as for the **tables**, the easy way is to use

```{r, eval = FALSE}
knitr::kable(table)
```

that permits to specify the `format` argument, e.g., `knitr::kable(table, format = "latex)`.



---
class: highlight-last-item

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Cross-references

If the output is `PDF`:

Insert a LaTeX label in the caption:

- `\label{table_caption}` for tables

--

- `\\label{figure_caption}` for figures


and then use the `\autoref{table_caption}`/`\autoref{figure_caption}` syntax in text.

---
class: highlight-last-item

### Ingredients of `Rmarkdown` document - Cross-references

If you want a `HTML` or `Word` output (this way also works for the `PDF` ones):

1. In the `YAML` you must specify as `output`:

  - `bookdown::word_document2:` for `word` output,
  - `bookdown::html_document2:` for `word` output,
  - `bookdown::pdf_document2:` for `PDF` output.
  
2. The label of the figure is the name of the chuck.

3. Use `\@ref(tab:name-of-the-chuck)` to cite the table and `\@ref(fig:name-of-the-chuck)` to cite the figure.
